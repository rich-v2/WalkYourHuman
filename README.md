# WalkYourHuman

## Installation & Launch

I could not be bothered to make an executable, so you'll have to install Python and the pygame module using

`pip install pygame`

Sorry!

You may start the game by executing the `main.py` file.

## Aim of the Game

Keep your human alive and defeat the final boss.

## Mechanics

Your human has two values: cholesterol and health. Cholesterol is constantly depleting whilst walking around and is increased by consuming food. Most enemies will target your human instead of you and try to increase his cholesterol. 

Once your humans cholesterol levels become too low, he will starve and lose health. He will die if his health reaches zero.

On the other hand, if the cholesterol level of your human exceeds a certain threshold, he will first become fat and slow and, after cholesterol is increased even more, will suffer a heart attack and die instantly. 

As a dog, you are tied to your human and cannot move too far away from him. However, you have a few tools at your disposal to support your human. Always keep a lookout for delicious sausages, they fill your tummy and increase your speed.
 
## Controls

`Arrow Keys`: Move. ➡️

`Q`: Bark. Scare off your foes in a small radius. Once an enemy has been scared away, he cannot be frightened again for a short period. 🐶

`E`: Poop. Lay out poop traps. Enemies that step into it will stop to clean off your poop from their shoes. 💩

`A`: Spawn Pug. Get in some friends. A pug will seek out the closest Meatball Flinger in its vicinity and eat any meatball he tries to throw.

`D`: Spawn Donkey. Call down divine intervention. The donkey is your secret weapon and will immobilize anyone in its vicinity due to its magnificent presence. 🫏

`Space`: Sic enemy. This should be your last resort. It is not okay to kill humans and you will be punished for doing so. Choose wisely if you need a permanent solution to your problems. 🩸

## Enemies

Ice Vendor: If he notices your human, he will follow him and shove ice cream in his face when in close proximity. 🍨

Meatball Flinger: He prefers to keep a distance and throw meatballs at your human. 🍖

Dog Catcher: Will try to subdue you for a short period if you have been a naughty boy. 👮

Final Boss: Who does a dog fear like no other? 🙊
